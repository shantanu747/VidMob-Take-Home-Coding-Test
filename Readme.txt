This program is a command-line driven program. Usage instructions are printed when calculator.py is run in terminal but are printed here again for reference:

USAGE:
"calculate _expression_" to evaluate an expression 
Example: "calculate 2+2" or "calculate 1 + 2"

"Done" to indicate you are done calculating and want to exit program

Note: "calculate" and "done" commands are not case sensitive so don't worry about that - just make sure there is a space between the "calculate" command and the expression
